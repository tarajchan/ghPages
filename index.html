                <h2>Dedicated to the World Wide Web</h2>
                  <p>This is Tara's first website that has been published on the internet. The site is undergoing
                  many changes constantly, so it would be uncommon to visit her website at another time of the day
                  to see its appearance change. You may wonder, "Why can't she make up her mind?" And she will ask you
                  the same exact question. Enjoy the time being, because one moment in time is just as valuable as the 
                  next or the present, which is where every human being exists at all times.
